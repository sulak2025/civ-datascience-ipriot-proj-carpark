## Vision

To provide a modern, real-time parking space availability system for the City of Moondalup, helping drivers easily find available parking spots in public parking lots and improving overall parking experience and traffic flow.

## Background

The city is looking to create a proof-of-concept (POC) to digitize their existing parking resources. The project is a low budget project to add sensors to **uncontrolled** parking lots (ones without a gate) in order to provide drivers and city administrators with live information about parking availability.

## User Stories

### User Story 1

As a driver, I want to know the number of available parking spots in a parking lot so that I can quickly find a spot to park my car.

### User Story 2

As a driver, I want to see the current temperature and time while checking for parking availability so that I can plan my activities accordingly.

### User Story 3

As a parking lot manager, I want to track cars entering and leaving the parking lot in real-time so that I can manage parking resources effectively.

## Technical Backlog Items

1. Develop a Python application to count cars entering and exiting the parking lot using SenseHat sensors.
3. Develop a Python application to display parking availability, temperature, and time on a suitable display.
4. Ensure proper data handling and error prevention (e.g., no negative parking spots).
5. Update the configuration file format to use TOML with the required attributes.

## Definition of Done

1. Cars entering and exiting the parking lot are accurately tracked, and a running total of available spots is maintained.
3. Parking availability, temperature, and time are displayed in a user-friendly format on a suitable display.
4. The system is tested and runs seamlessly. A Raspberry Pi with SenseHat may be used to generate signals instead of the provided user interface.
5. The code is well-documented, object-oriented, and follows best practices.
6. A system test (using the python unittest module) is executed with the provided scenario data. 

## Functional Requirements Summary

1. The system must count cars entering and exiting the parking lot.
2. The system must maintain a running total of available parking spots.
3. The system must log its activity to a file as events arise.
4. The system must display parking availability, temperature, and time on a suitable display.

## Non-Functional Requirements Summary

1. The system must be written in Python and run on a Raspberry Pi with the SenseHat.
2. The system must use an object-oriented programming approach.
3. The system must display the parking availability updates in real-time.
4. The system must provide a user-friendly interface for drivers.
5. The system must handle edge cases, such as full parking lots and more cars than available spots.
